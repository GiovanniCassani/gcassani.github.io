        <p>
            Currently Assistant Professor at the Department of Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence (CSAI) 
            at Tilburg University.
            <br /><br />
            Previously, I collaborated with <a href="http://tooso.ai/" target="_blank">Tooso</a> on project about 
            user intent prediction on e-commerce websites. I have a Ph.D. in Computational Psycholinguistics obtained 
            from the <a href="https://www.uantwerpen.be/clips/" target="_blank">CLiPS</a> Research Center of the University 
            of Antwerp with a research focused on how children learn lexical categories
            (<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/333171526_The_bootstrapping_toolbox_Which_cues_are_more_useful_to_learn_lexical_categories_and_why" target="_blank">PhD thesis</a>).
            Before the PhD, I got a MSc in Cognitive Science at the Center for Mind/Brain Sciences of the University of Trento 
            using computational linguistics and computer vision to study how children build conceptual representations from words and images
            (<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284727216_Distributional_Semantics_for_Child_Directed_Speech_a_Multimodal_Approach" target="_blank">MSc thesis</a>), 
            and a BA in Literature and Linguistics also at the University of Trento, studying conceptual representations 
            in congenitally blind people using feature norms (BA thesis).
            <br /><br />
            I worked for a while at the press office of the University of Trento and like science communication very much. 
            I play volleyball, improvise, cook, go to concerts, watch plays, movies and series, cycle, read, buy vinyls.
            <br /><br />
            If you want to know more about what I did and do you can check my 
            <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/giovannicassani/" target="_blank">Linkedin profile</a> and

# RESEARCH INTERESTS
</pre>
        <p>
            * Cognitive stuff: Computational models of language acquisition, Conceptual representations, 
            Semantics, Category learning 
            <br /><br />
            A bunch of interesting questions to which I'd love to find an answer: <br />
            How do children learn their native languages? What information do they rely upon? Whin learning models 
            do the job? How do they form and represent concepts and categories? How do they understand meaning? 
            What is the relation between language and perceptual information in creating meaning, concepts, 
            and categories? How does what you know influence what you learn?
        </p>
      
        <p>
            * Data stuff: user intent prediction, sequence modeling
            <br /><br />
            Problems I'd like to collaborate on: <br />
            Deciding whether a user si going to perform a certain action on a website or not depending on 
            how s/he interacts with the website, modeling labor market trajectories using sequence modeling and language
            models to learn a grammar of unemployment, identify people at risk of dropping out of school, therapies or
            the like using data about their interactions with teachers, doctors and so on, ...
        </p>
      
        <p>
            * Stuff I'd like to do more with: brain imaging, cognitive psychology
            <br /><br />
            If you're working on problems about brain imaging or cognitive psychology where 
            my expertise in computational modeling, statistics, and data analysis may come in handy drop me a line,
            I'd love to be involved!
